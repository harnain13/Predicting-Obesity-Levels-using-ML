# Predicting Obesity Levels using Machine Learning:

### Project Overview:
This project explores the predictive capabilities of machine learning algorithms in assessing obesity levels using a dataset comprising diverse individual attributes such as demographic factors, lifestyle indicators (diet, physical activity), and health metrics (height, weight). The dataset categorizes individuals into seven obesity classes, ranging from Insufficient Weight to severe obesity categories (Type I, II, III) and overweight levels (Level I, II). Feature engineering techniques, including BMI calculation and numerical transformations, were employed to enhance predictive accuracy. Seven machine learning models i.e., K Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting classifiers were implemented and evaluated for their efficacy in classifying obesity levels.

### Conclusion:
The study demonstrated strong performance with models like LightGBM and XGBoost, achieving high accuracy and AUC values, highlighting robust predictive capabilities. Various algorithms were comprehensively evaluated, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses. Challenges included addressing class imbalance and concerns about overfitting, particularly with decision trees and gradient boosting methods. Interpretability posed challenges with advanced models due to their "black box" nature, complicating understanding of decision-making processes.

This project underscores the feasibility of machine learning in predicting obesity levels based on lifestyle and physiological attributes, emphasizing the importance of model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and addressing data challenges to achieve optimal performance.
